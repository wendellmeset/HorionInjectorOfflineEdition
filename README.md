# HorionInjectorOfflineEdition
A DnSpyEX modification of the original horion injector that instead injects from a local file named Horion.dll!

For context, the original Horion Injector from https://horion.download downloads the dll from the internet every time you inject it, which not only means you need an internet connection to actually inject it, but it also means the injection process is a bit slower, and if the website goes down, you are no longer able to inject it. However, the kind folks at horion have kindly given us an easy way to directly download the dll for ourselves, and this modified injector, instead of downloading the dll from their website, injects a pre downloaded copy of their dll from the folder it is in. I will give you a pre-downloaded dll from the official website in the releases section that you need to put in the same folder as the injector. However if for some reason my repository every becomes outdated, you can simply download the official dll by going to: https://horion.download/bin/Horion.dll which is where horion injector normally downloads its dll from. After downloading it, put it in same folder that you put this custom injector into, and inject it like you normally would inject horion. Instead of using the web dll, it will use the local one in your current directory, enjoy this epic software!!!!!! :D :) :D :)
